"This place is perfectly located, very close to Durbar Square and most major spots in Kathmandu. I would highly recommend it for its warm hospitality. The staff constantly checked in to ensure I was having a great experience.
A special shout-out to Usha at the reception for her quick responses and regular follow-ups to make sure I was comfortable. I also loved the open space on the top floor, where Arjun kindly served me coffee along with a complimentary breakfast.
I’m truly happy with my stay and would definitely choose the same place again when I visit Kathmandu.

We were tired to search for other hotels because of fatigue and called this place to pick us up as we were lost because of bad navigation from google map.

"We stayed here several times between our travels around Nepal. The staff were super friendly and helpful and we could store our luggage without a problem. We stayed in the cheaper and the more expensive rooms and both are good value for money. The location is perfect if you want to shop things for trekking. They also have a travel agency in the hotel than can help you book buses and more for a fair price, but they don't push you to book tours/trips you don't really want.
One star is missing because there is mold in some of the rooms so maybe not too healthy if you plan to stay a long time.

"This was the best stay I have had on my travels, clean rooms, nice shower, but the golden jewel here is the people, the family who own it are the most accomodating and caring people I have ever met. With one short conversation you will learn their passion for languages, they will feed you until you can eat no more and they won't ask for a dime extra for the meal. The nightly cost is so low but the experience is of the highest quality they are truly beautiful people and to make it better they have a jaw dropping roof top view for you to enjoy. I can't recommend this highly enough! Thank you Sara and Sudan,  I will definitely be back.

1. Food is not good. They serve cold and yesterday’s food.
2. There is water problem ,the tap does not work
3. The tv does not function properly.
4. No hot water
5. No lift system
6. they cant serve most of the things that they have on the menu.
7. I also did find 1..2 cockroaches in the room.
8. No buffet breakfast in the morning is a huge 🚩for me. I did not know that when i booked a room here.
9. The toilet also has problems.
10. Very Slow  wifi

Overall they are nice people.
They do respond and try to help. But a hotel like this is only ok in case of emergencies and when you have no other option to stay in another hotel.

I am giving 1 star because they respond every time i had a problem. And that they were not rude with me.

Rooms are clean and well maintained. The price is very reasonable. Food is great. You won't find this quality of rooms and service at this price in Kathmandu.

This hotel has only one benefit that it is near to airport. The food is really bad. Even a cup of tea is really bad they don’t know how to make a tea even and that also costs 200. Bathrooms on third floor don’t have option of hot water. I won’t recommend to anyone.,5,"a month ago on
